						<h3>About Me</h3>
					</div>
					<div class="one-column-content__text js-ease container">
						<p>Hello! My name is Brandon! Iâ€™m an aspiring software developer who wants to learn everything about software development. I began my professional career as an accountant, and noticed even from the schooling that I lacked passion for the field. I knew it was time for a career change when I began dreading going into the office every day. I was introduced to web development and began taking online courses to learn different languages. From the start I fell in love with coding. I have always had an interest for technology and computers so I decided to put all of my effort into learning the skills needed for a new career in web development! I love the problem solving aspect of coding and getting to build things that are unique and awesome! I am fascinated that there is almost always more than one way to solve a problem. Throughout my experience with online classes and projects, I have really enjoyed learning some of the different languages and am so excited to put my skills toward creating amazing things! I understand I do not have much experience but my 3 month internship at Devetry as a software engineer has taught me amazing things about the field. I am even more driven to succeed now that I have had a taste of what it is like to be a Software Engineer. My portfolio below represents some of the things I enjoyed learning on my own and at Devetry. I believe these projects display my current skillset. Please see link below for my resume.</p>

							<h3>Angular Sort on a Table</h3>
							<p>Most of my time spent at my internship at Devetry involved working with the AngularJS framework. I loved working with this javaScript framework and hope to get chances to work with this in the future! One of my primary tasks while working here was to develop a custom sort on a few of the tables on a project with an enormous codebase. This was interesting as I have not worked with a codebase so large before. After looking up a few things and going through a tutorial or two, I felt comfortable tackling this challenge. My first attempt looked promising as I used a function called by the ng-click directive to allow clicking on the table header title of each column to sort the column by ascending or descending order. The only issue was that there was nothing showing that this functionality was available at first glance without knowing the functionality was there. My solution to this was returning the arrow-down class on the else statement instead of a blank string! This solution shows the sort arrow next to the header title at all times, which shows the user that this sort capability is available just by looking at the table. This functionality pairs perfectly with the filter functionality described in the next project on my portfolio. To see a working demo and corresponding code for this project please see the JSFiddle below.</p>

							<h3>Angular Filter on a Table</h3>
							<p>Another one of my primary tasks while working here was to develop a filter on a table which allows the user to search by any of the columns. The greatest challenge to creating this was trying to get the filter to actually filter by each corresponding column as this was my first experience with AngularJS. Also, a difficult function to figure out was being able to filter multiple columns at the same time. Originally I had written a complex function that worked, but there was a much simpler way to get AngularJS to do exactly what I wanted to do. This functionality pairs perfectly with the sort function described in my first portfolio item allowing the use of a table with both filter and sort capabilities! This was truly a great learning experience and amazing introduction to a language I fell in love with. Please see JSFiddle below for the demo and corresponding code.</p>

							<h3>Photo Gallery Search</h3>
							<p>This project was one of my favorite in learning JavaScript and jQuery. It also allowed me to reinforce some of my html and css skills. I started the project by building out the gallery using HTML and CSS to follow the design of the mockup provided to me. My next step was to find a plugin for a lightbox feature. I researched and found the plugin Magnific Popup, which I loved! I was able to implement this into my project fairly easily and formatted the lightbox to look identical to the mockup with the caption centered below the image. The most daunting part of this project was creating the search box that allows the user to search images by the caption and only show results matching what is input into the search box. After many failed plugin attempts I decided to research how I could code this my self with JavaScript. I researched and found what I needed to make this work with some simple JavaScript and jQuery. I had to target my searchbox with an ID and make a function that ran on each keyup so that the searchbox would search in live time. The function logged the value of the user input and converted each value to lowercase so there would be no discrepancy regardless of the user typing in upper or lowercase. The function then would hide or show images in the gallery based on if the input from the user matched anything in the caption text. See the JSfiddle below for the demo.</p>

							<h3>JavaScript Drawing Application</h3>
							<p>This project was one of the coolest ones I created. This demo was taught to me from one of my courses. This simple drawing application allows the user to either choose from the preset color pallet or create their own color to add to the pallet to draw with. The html template was provided to me with none of the JavaScript or jQuery functionality working. The first major problem was to figure out how to get the new color button to work and toggle the screen that accessed the sliders used for color creation! I did this by setting each of the sliders to have a range from 0 to 255 to include the entire color spectrum. Once this is selected by the user the colors are logged into an RGB element to produce a color. This color is previewed to the left of the sliders so the user can see what they are adding to the pallet. The next part of the project invloced appending the new color to the pallet when the user clicks the "Add Color" button. At this point, I was learning a lot about the .append and .click commands in order to make the new color active as the user clicked the "Add Color" button. The final part of the project was getting the user to be able to physically draw on the canvas with the colors they selected. This process familiarized me with the .mouseDown, .mousemove, and .mouseup functions to get the application to correctly draw only when the user has the mouse clicked down and moves to any point on the canvas. See the JSfiddle below for a demo of this project.</p>

							<h3>Media Query Project</h3>
							<p>This responsive layout project was really interesting. This put to the test my knowledge of media queries to implement 3 different portfolio designs at the mobile, tablet, and desktop views. I began this project by establishing the HTML and CSS for the mobile mockup. After getting all of the functionality of the portfolio at the mobile level, I created a media query for the tablet view which changed the navigation, header, and portfolio gallery. In the mobile view everything was stacked on top of eachother so everything could easily be viewed by the user scrolling down. The first step was to set the max width of the container to the tablet view (768px). I set the display of the navigation to inline block so each navigation option was displayed next to eachother under my name. Then to address the portfolio gallery design I set the font size of the list items to 0. Then I set the display of the list items to inline block with a width of 50% to make sure they would only display 2 images per row. I reset the font size to initial and the result turned out great! For the desktop display I made another change to the navigation by floating it to the right so it no longer appeared under my name. I had a very similar approach to the portfolio gallery as they wanted 3 images per row in the desktop view. To make this work I simply set the new width of the list items to 33.3333% to make them display 3 images across.

							<h3>JavaScript Quiz</h3>
							<p>This project is a JavaScript quiz that will ask the user 3 questions that started in an array. After the user submits their answer to the 3 questions. The JavaScript program will tell the user how many questions they got right. The program will also tell the user which questions they answered correct and incorrect. This project was a great for practicing JavaScript. I utilized and gained better knowledge of the .push and return commands as well as logging items to an array, which became very useful in other projects, such as my Photo Gallery Search box. This project also allowed me to practice loops, which were difficult to grasp, but practicing on projects like this help better understand them. Please see the demo below on JSFiddle.</p>

							<h3>Registration Form Styles</h3>
							<p>This was my first project creating an online registration form. First, I used HTML and CSS to build out the form to match the mockup. I used differnt input types like text, email, checkboxes, and radio buttons. Also, one of the sections utilized a select box used to choose from a list of states as well as a textarea element to allow users to input comments at the bottom. One of the biggest challenges during this project was getting the labels that describe each input field to display on the left of the input field instead of over them. To fix this, I wrapped each pair of labels and inputs into a div element with the class "block". After that, I was able to display them inline block. The final part was to set each elements width so the content would display identical to the mockup! Please see the demo below on JSFiddle.</p>
